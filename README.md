# FlexJS_PureMVC
flexjs try and PureMVC multicore

Install Apache FlexJS 0.5 or newer using the Apache Flex SDK Installer. http://flex.apache.org/installer.html

before running the script (Make.bat) you need to change the first line of the three files:
set FLEX_JS_HOME=C:/Sviluppo/Flex/SDK/js-05

Integration with PureMVC multicore and my personal library seems to be successful

I had temporarily sostutuire some libraries as " mx.utils.UIDUtil " and other ... they gave errors at compile time .

I did not use mxml , the main application forces me to assign a model, view , command . I do not like to be forced .
